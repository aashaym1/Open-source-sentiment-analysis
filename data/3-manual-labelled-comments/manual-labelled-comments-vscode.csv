586,755345856,"For images making a selection is something that you may want to undo, for example selections can be polygons, you can invert selections, you can add to them, etc. I found myself always leaving dirty editors when opening an image, selecting all and copying is the main thing I saw here. This gets worse when retain context is false because backup didn't get a chance to run. ",2021-01-06T14:55:26Z,anger

589,755350968,Assigning to as he expected that this can be flaky. Chatted with about this and I agree with him that a functionality test shall be different from performance test. I would recommend following: Have a unit test that tests create file in batches but with smaller number of files Have a separate perf unit test to validate the performance and we can skip it to run on builds. We can enable it locally if needed to check perf.,2021-01-06T15:03:39Z,joy

593,755354081,Totally agree. We shouldn't have unit tests that validate performance because we run them a gazillion times locally and on the build machine and it isn't useful as they just burn CPU. We should have them skipped or something and they can be executed manually whenever a change is made to the indexdb code to validate that the perf was not affected.,2021-01-06T15:08:39Z,anger
