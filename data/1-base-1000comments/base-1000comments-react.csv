You're passing the ref via `innerRef` prop. It should be passed via `ref`.
```js
return React.cloneElement(child, {
  ref: node =>

639474427,"As a workaround to the problem of not being able to call a hook conditionally, I am using the following workaround which wraps the hook into a conditional component call via a render prop:

https://unsplash.com/blog/calling-react-hooks-conditionally-dynamically-using-render-props/

```tsx
const RenderFunction = ({ children }) => children();

const MyComponent = ({ shouldRenderHook }) =>
  shouldRenderHook ? (
    <RenderFunction>
      {() => {
        // `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks` error:
        // React Hook ""React.useState"" cannot be called inside a callback. React Hooks must be
        // called in a React function component or a custom React Hook function.
        const [state, setState] = React.useState(0);
        return (
          <div>
            State: {state}
            <button onClick={() => setState(currentState => currentState + 1)}>
              Increment
            </button>
          </div>
        );
      }}
    </RenderFunction>
  ) : (
    <div>Rendering the hook shortly…</div>
  );
```

https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-conditional-hooks-simple

IIUC, this is perfectly safe because the `children` render prop callback is called every time the `RenderFunction` component is called, yet the ESLint rule throws an error.

It would be great if there was a way to tell the ESLint rules that this is safe.

For context: I understand that an alternative workaround would be just to extract another component, but that is not always desirable because then you lose access to the component's closure, which means you have to drill things down.

708212345,"I want to point out that from my experience, people often fall into one of the following three categories:
1. people who don't have any idea of what `memo` is and never use it
2. people who kinda know it helps with performance and uses `memo` almost everywhere
3. people who try adding it in places that are expected to benefit from it

All of them usually forget to memorize some super important component here and there (the website's `Header` is a classic example) or memoize a component and pass it an always invalidated prop like `style={{width: '100%'}}` so it renders again and again.

Sometimes these places render many components, have logic and side effects. Sometimes they are rendered very often.

I think the biggest benefit of making everything pure is ""keeping it simple"" by removing this feature altogether, even though, in some cases, it would make the application a little slower.",2020-10-14T07:19:42Z

717361482,"We've got a workaround that's simple and effective in theory [here](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-overlays/blob/master/src/useRootClose.ts#L91). Need to let folks test it out a bit though. Alternatively I think adding listeners in a` setImmediate` would work albeit pretty annoying to manage in an effect.

For anyone looking, our current workaround is 
```js
useEffect(() => {
  // Note this depends on a deprecated but extremely well 
  // supported quirk of the web platform, this may be less effective 
  // for other event types, YMMV
  const currentEvent = window.event

  element.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
     if (e === currentEvent) {
        currentEvent = null;
        return
     } 
     // do the work
  })

  // ...clean up
})

729716654,"My understanding is we have two workarounds suggested that are both valid, with different considerations, but only one listed in the top of this issue. I wonder if they both should be @fritz-c, or if we deliberately just list one?

The first by @gaearon that solves/swallows these errors globally, at some performance cost:

https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11538#issuecomment-417504600

> Finally, there is a workaround you can use that will fix the error. It will make your app a little bit slower, so it is up to you to try it and determine whether the tradeoff is worth it. But it's equivalent to what React would have to do if we were to fix it in React — so you wouldn't have a better solution anyway. 
> 
> Once Google Translate fixes this (if https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=872770 gets any traction — it's hard to tell) you'll be able to remove the hack.

The second by @shuhei on a per usage basis, so no performance cost but no guard against reintroducing errors:  

https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11538#issuecomment-390386520

754600189,"With all the respect, wrapper doesn't sound like cheating, it is cheating. Tree shaking and other tools to analyze code which know only about ES6 modules semantics won't fully work with it ever. If there will be major release of React, I think it will be more beneficial for community to go with correct ES6 modules and named-only exports, that's what versioning is about to do breaking changes if they are really necessary. If there is problem with tooling (to bundle two versions or other issue) it should be probably fixed on tooling side. ",2021-01-05T12:15:51Z
754629378,"@juliuskovac tree shaking works equally well with CJS, it's just not enabled by default in the popular bundlers, so they could *already* handle things without any ESM whatsoever if it was important to do so.

754715121,"I assure you, it is not a question of ""defaults"". It is not impossible, but at least for Rollup, there is still some engineering effort necessary to safely track usage of object properties as would be required for CommonJS tree-shaking. And beyond tree-shaking, scope-hoisting is another optimization you forego without ES modules. In short it means you have a lot more property accesses with the incurred runtime penalty in a CommonJS setting. Rollup is actively trying to reduce these, but it requires libraries to be sufficiently ""well-behaved"". In short, it is quite hard to produce similar quality output from CommonJS modules as opposed to ES modules.",2021-01-05T15:41:24Z

Sorry about that 😞 , was in a bit of deadline that's why. But will keep in mind for future.

Btw is there any interest towards enabling github discussions on this repo ? Because lots of issues could belong better in Github discussions.

755295797,"ok @yasintz I gave it some more thought and here's what I'm thinking. I don't think we should include the field specifier in the regex, because doing pre-parsing on a regex doesn't sound like fun, and would probably be confusing to use too. So I'm thinking we expand the config to be something like:

```
{
  ...
  ""safeHooks"": [
    {
      ""pattern"": ""^useCustomState$"",
      ""fields"": [1]
    },
    ""^useRefWrapper$""
  ]
}
```

And you can specify any number of hooks in that array, or you can stick with the original format of just using regex unions to specify multiple hooks, if you don't need disjoint field logic. Another added bonus of this format is that it's easy to specify stable fields from hooks that return objects too, you just include a string in `fields` instead of a number.

I think we should continue to support the original format of just a regex as well though, to stay consistent with `additionalHooks` and also minimize the amount of config needed for the simplest cases. So overall I think the typing for this field would look something like:

```
type SafeHook = string | {pattern: string, fields?: Array<string | number>};
type SafeHooks = SafeHook | SafeHook[];
```

If we decide on this design, it also means that we could merge what I have in this PR, then extend it to support this design without requiring any breaking changes, since the simple string format will still be supported. I'd prefer that since I just started a new job so my time is pretty limited right now, and I'd rather get this out for use as soon as possible. I'm still happy to do the implementation of this design too, it'll just probably take me a few weeks.

Let me know what you think!",2021-01-06T13:21:59Z

755866890,"Adding a solution here because this page is showing up on the front page of Google when searching for ""React.cloneElement keep child props""

Let's say you are passing in the new color:

```
React.cloneElement(child, {
	this.props.color
});
```
This will override the color prop for the child element.

So, you need to pass in the child props again **after** passing in the parent's props:

```
React.cloneElement(child, {
	this.props.color,
	...child.props,
});
```

Any props that are set by the child will override the values of the props set by the cloneElement.

If you wanted to create an order of precedence:
1. Props provided to the child component
2. Props provided to the parent
3. Default props on the child component

List the props in reverse order:
```
React.cloneElement(child, {
	...defaultProps,
	this.props.color,
	...child.props,
});

756437676,we had two versions of React being installed in a monorepo. needed to use metro's `blacklistRE` field and alias `react` to root `node_modules`,2021-01-07T22:58:19Z
756497531,"Looking at the source code now, there's a comment that seems to indicate that `useEffect` / `useCallback` / `useMemo` dependencies arrays are intended to be passed inline:

https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/efc57e5cbbd618f3c98d941c48eec859026c2dcb/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberHooks.new.js#L310

```js
...
if (__DEV__) {
    // Don't bother comparing lengths in prod because these arrays should be
    // passed inline.
    if (nextDeps.length !== prevDeps.length) {
       ...
```

If that's the case then it makes sense that it doesn't want the array length to change. But that just changes the question slightly - I'd love to hear from someone on the React team as to why the'd like these dependency arrays to only be passed inline to `useEffect`, `useCallback` and `useMemo`. I'm not able to think of any future movements that they might be leaving open for themselves, but that said I really haven't spent much time looking at their code.

756525895,"Intermediate thing to get you all through. My tests seem to confirm it's all good, but still, use with caution.

```js
import {useEffect, useRef} from 'react';

const equal = (a: unknown[], b: unknown[]): boolean => {
    if(a === b) return true;
    if(a.length !== b.length) return false;
    return a.every((e,i) => Object.is(e,b[i]));
};

export const useEffectVariadic = (create: () => (() => void)|void, deps: unknown[]): void => {
    const prevDeps = useRef<unknown[]>([]);
    const count = useRef<number>(0);

    if(!equal(prevDeps.current, deps)) count.current++;
    prevDeps.current = deps;

    useEffect(create, [count.current]);
};

// usage like normal useEffect

useEffectVariadic(() => {
    console.log(""hi"");
}, variableLengthArrayOfStuff);

```",2021-01-08T03:35:19Z
756533082,"Yeah I've been bitten by this one too. Not a `useMemo`, but the same limitation and error: I wanted to fire a `useEffect` whenever the contents of a variable length array changes. The array could contain many different data shapes, and I want to check equality using `Object.is()` style strict equality, so tried to do this:

```js
let items: T[] = [];
// ^ or [{foo: true}], or [1,2,3], or [true] etc depending on the generics used outside of this component

useEffect(() => {
    console.log(""changed"");
}, items);
```
And obviously hit this odd limitation.

My potential approaches seem to be:
- Use one `useEffect` per `item`? Items can change length, so the rules of hooks disallow this, which is fine. 
- Use one `useEffect` and pass in an array of items? The dependency length error is thrown.
- Transform the array to get it into a format that `useEffect` is ok with
  - If the array is homogeneous, elements are uniquely identifiable, and the data shape can be known to the hook, then this can sometimes work i.e. `let users: User = [{id: 'foo'}];` and `useEffect(() => {}, [users.map(user => user.id).join(',')])`, but is not suitable for my case as I can't / shouldn't need to know the shape of the items in advance, and I need to use Object.is() style strict equality for comparison.
  - If the array is fine with being checked for equality deeply then `useEffect(() => {}, [JSON.stringify(items)])` might be ok sometimes, but is not suitable for my case as I need to use `Object.is()` style strict equality for comparison
  - If you're ok with a maximum limit on your items then maybe `useEffect(() => {}, Array(10).fill(undefined).map((v,i) => items[i]))`, but is not suitable for my case as I have no reasonable limit I can impose
  - Roll my own hook that circumvents the limitation
  
So just had to do the last one. It's for `useEffect`, but equally applicable to the other hooks. My tests say it's ok but please use it with caution.

```js
import {useEffect, useRef} from 'react';

const equal = (a: unknown[], b: unknown[]): boolean => {
    if(a === b) return true;
    if(a.length !== b.length) return false;
    return a.every((e,i) => Object.is(e,b[i]));
};

export const useEffectVariadic = (create: () => (() => void)|void, deps: unknown[]): void => {
    const prevDeps = useRef<unknown[]>([]);
    const count = useRef<number>(0);

    if(!equal(prevDeps.current, deps)) count.current++;
    prevDeps.current = deps;

    useEffect(create, [count.current]);
};

// usage like normal useEffect

useEffectVariadic(() => {
    console.log(""hi"");
}, variableLengthArrayOfStuff);

756954021,"For another solution, using React hooks, you can still keep the state in the editable element, no need to move it up to the parent, and also fix the caret position too.

It's a hacky way to do it, but it works.

It fixes the caret positioning by getting the caret offset on the editable element using a ref, setting the state then setting that same caret offset back on the element ref after the state is updated.

It was tested in Chrome only, and for simple text content, but theoretically, it should work if the editable element contains child nodes too, I will test it and update the code pen.

If I understood it correctly then you're dispatching in the reducer. I would consider calling `dispatch` in a [reducer a side-effect which is not allowed in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/strict-mode.html#detecting-unexpected-side-effects). I think you need to wrap the `dispatch` and call the middleware when you want to dispatch not when you're ""reducing"".",2021-01-11T09:41:53Z

It's not clear from the code you posted that the code isn't doing any state updates. Could you reduce this as much as possible so that we end up with a single test and every bit of component code visible in the repro? Otherwise it'll be very hard to identify how that false positive was produced.",2021-01-11T09:46:17Z

Would something like double-clicking the key to make it editable be better? 

Looking at the sources tab in Chrome it is not possible to edit a variable name there when debugging. The same goes for the debug panel in VS Code.  Both of them supports collapse/extend when clicking the keys.

I don't think it makes sense conceptually to edit a variable name in the sources panel. (What would that even do?)

> In Chrome you double-click on the value to edit it; In VS Code you can double click on either key or value to edit the value.

I've designed the props/state/hooks editable interface to work like Chrome's style editor in the Elements panel. I think this is a pretty familiar interface for most web developers. That panel allows you to start editing by focusing on either a key or value field.",2021-01-11T13:50:01Z
758008070,"Cleaned this up a bit. My component organization here is still a little janky (e.g. the reason I have the memo-busting counter). I could refactor to move the context lower, within the suspense boundary, so that I could just cache on the object itself, but I noticed a lingering update that never completes (just re-renders at an interval) the first time I use `startTransition` to clear a warning.

Maybe I should do a more heavy refactor and try to remove this context entirely. _Something_ needs to poll for updates and refresh the cache but it doesn't necessarily need to be a context provider that sits above the Suspense boundary.

I may still be missing something about how the pieces for this kind of cache fit together. It's more complex than our fs/db cache implementations, since there are a couple of cases for invalidation (polled update from the backend, hydrated path, user clicked to clear errors/warnings). Normally I would refer to other places we're using the API but it seems like our `useCacheRefresh` API hasn't really been used for anything yet, outside of a couple of tests.",2021-01-11T15:03:33Z
758012979,"@rickhanlonii This issue is a variation of a request for reparenting support (#3965). Some components (subtrees) are expensive to create/destroy but there's no way to move them around other than destroying and recreating (and also lifting up/restoring any state that goes along with them).

I'm not sure the proposed mechanism makes sense to me though. In the very simplified example given, the proposal would be overkill obviously– and I'm not sure if it would make sense in a larger, more ""real world app"" context. Definitely seems like something that would need to go through our RFC process regardless: https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs#react-rfcs

The other issue is that [strict mode seems to break functionality](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-react/issues/651).

We only disable the console in the second call, you should still see logs from the first call.

> Starting with React 17, React automatically modifies the console methods like console.log() to silence the logs in the **second call** to lifecycle functions. 

If we didn't do this, the console would contain duplicate messages so we made the tradeoff to disable it in the second pass. This can have side effects, which we offer a [workaround for](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/20090#issuecomment-715927125).",2021-01-12T14:48:09Z

I don't have a strong preference either though.

Regarding the example: I don't think this should be allowed. If `useHook` throws internally because, e.g., we're accessing something on a `null`'d `useContext` field, we'd exit `useHook` early/conditionally before calling any remaining hooks in it.",2021-01-12T16:21:08Z

Hi @paolorr , have you figured it out? I have implemented a similar cart reducer and encountered the same issue, have you figured out how to solve it?",2021-01-14T03:53:29Z
759916294,"@paolorr I have figured out the issue in my code.

Before:
```
// the issue here is that I mutate the quantity value.
cart.purchases[index] = {
  product: action.product,
  quantity: cart.purchases[index].quantity + 1,
};
```

After: 
```
// I was mutating purchases and now increment its quantity in an immutable way:
  const incrementPurchasesQuantity = (purchases: Purchase[], index: number) => {
      return [
        ...purchases.slice(0, index),
        { ...purchases[index], quantity: purchases[index].quantity + 1 },
        ...purchases.slice(index + 1),
      ];
  };


  cart = {
   shop,  // this is another field in cart, ignore it in this case
    purchases: incrementPurchasesQuantity(purchases, index),
  };

```
Hope it helps.

760081891,"Thanks for the reproducible example!

You're logging twice:
1. `console.log(""roo"");` logs `""roo""`
2. `console.log(ref.current.say());` which logs the return value of `say()` which is `undefined` so you log `undefined`

In the title you're saying `ref.current` is `undefined` sometimes but in your repro `ref.current.say()` would crash if that would be the case.

> The expected behavior
> aways get roo

```diff
    say() {
      console.log(""roo"");
+     return ""roo""
    }

> Error happens while trying to use the profiler on my React app on Chrome

Could you elaborate a bit more on this point:

1. Does this happen with every app or just your app? If it only happens with your app can you reduce this to a minimal example and share with us?
2. What exact steps in the profiler lead to this error?

This looks familiar to https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/20359

> <script src=""https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/17.0.1/umd/react.<%=  process.env.NODE_ENV==='development'?'development':'production' %>.min.js""></script>

There is no `development.min.js`. You're probably never hitting this branch in the ternary and always use the production bundle. Mixing the React production bundle with the JSX dev bundle is already identified as the cause of https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/20359

Maybe your `NODE_ENV` isn't set at all? Usually the dev/prod flags are checked by `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'`.

Could you share a cloneable repro that I can tinker with?",2021-01-14T09:55:56Z
760137511,"This should be reopened! The explanation here - why this issue is closed - is definitely wrong!
Yes there is a problem with standards compliance. But if standard compliance would be the reason for this issue, it would fail in dev mode, too! That's because the browser is always in production mode, whether react is in dev or not!

So there is definitely a fixable bug in react causing the dev mode to work different from production!

760208457,"> (As a side note, I think we should start preparing semver releases using the prepare-release-from-ci script, too, and get rid of prepare-release-from-npm. I think downloading from npm was a neat idea originally, but because we already run npm pack before storing the artifacts in CI, there's really not much additional safety; the only safeguard it adds is the requirement that a ""next"" release must have already been published.)

What's the main motivation for this change? Seems like that's a nice safeguard, though it's admittedly not totally necessary. What additional benefit do we get from publishing from CI?",2021-01-14T13:50:24Z
760248754,"Thanks your debugging. As read  your express and rewrite my example code, I thank it may be other issue.

My opinion of this report is some times I call  `ref.current.foo()` as say, `ref.current.say()` , and got `null` or `undefined`.

I can understand the logic of this issue, the `ref.current` has been re-assigned to the default state. maybe anther component’s re-render cause it.

I’ll debug on my code first. So, let me close this issue, and say thanks again.

760788564,"I'm running into the same issue as @blixt above. I have a stateful non-React class for API accesses that I pass around the app, and I define a `useFetchAPI()` hook function inside of it that I only call from function components. It would be nice to not require adding explicit comments to disable ESLint for those lines.",2021-01-15T09:46:56Z
760799977,"Thanks for the report.

The problem is that you're re-creating the `img` DOM element on every render so after every render the `onLoad` effect will be fire. Since you cause a re-render with your `onLoad`, the component re-renders indefinitely.

The reason for that is [how React reconciles two UI trees](https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html#elements-of-different-types). If it finds two elements with a different type it throws a way the whole tree of the old element.

In your `App` you're returning `<RenderLogo />`. When React compares the old element with the new element it'll find that the component types are different and throws away the old tree created by the element. That old tree contains the `img` element so it mounts a new `img` element and a new `onLoad` event is fired. The element type changes because you create it inside the render function:

```js
const RenderLogo = () => {
  console.log(""Rendering logo!"");
  return <img onLoad={handleLoad} src={logo} />;
};

return <RenderLogo />; 
```

What you can do to avoid this, is move the `RenderLogo` outside of the `App` component and pass props to it instead:

```jsx
const RenderLogo = ({ logo, onLoad }) => {
  console.log(""Rendering logo!"");
  return <img onLoad={onLoad} src={logo} />;
};

export default function App() {
  ...
  return <RenderLogo logo={logo} onLoad={handleLoad} />
}
```

I hope that helps. Please let me know if anything is unclear.",2021-01-15T10:09:07Z

760932400,"Hello,
Your explanation, for the most part, makes total sense. I definitely understand in principle now that I set myself up for an infinite loop with the way that I structured RenderLogo.

That said, I do have one final question at this point. Why does setting a variable in the way that I did trigger a re-render of the screen? That's ultimately my biggest source of confusion at this point.

Thanks again for your help!",2021-01-15T13:09:06Z
760958756,"> Why does setting a variable in the way that I did trigger a re-render of the screen? 

It triggers a re-render if the received value in `setState(value)` is not equal (`Object.is` equality but ""referential equality"" is the relevant part here) to the current state. Since you call it with `setTestObject({test: 'This triggers an infinite loop'});` the received value is always different compared to the current value (`Object.is({test: 'This triggers an infinite loop'}, {test: 'This triggers an infinite loop'}); // returns false`). 

You can think of it in another way:
`setState` always triggers a re-render. However, in some scenarios it does not (it ""bails out"") which are described in [Hooks reference: Bailing out of a state update](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#bailing-out-of-a-state-update)

761003231,"I've refactored the way the frontend loads component props/state/etc to hopefully make it better match the Suspense+cache model. Doing this gave up some of the small optimizations I'd added but hopefully the actual performance impact of that is minor and the overall ergonomic improvements of working with the cache API make this worth it.

The backend no longer remembers inspected paths. Instead, the frontend sends them every time and the backend sends a response with those paths. I've also added a new ""force"" parameter that the frontend can use to tell the backend to send a response even if the component hasn't rendered since the last time it asked. (This is used to get data for newly inspected paths.)

Here's an example scenario:

_Initial inspection..._
```
front |                                                      | back
      | -- ""inspect"" (id:1, paths:[], force:true) ---------> |
      | <------------------------ ""inspected"" (full-data) -- |
```
_1 second passes with no updates..._
```
      | -- ""inspect"" (id:1, paths:[], force:false) --------> |

761019442,"Seems suspicious that it's only discovered many months after the 16.14 release. I'd bet that something is wrong with the polyfilling, but I don't know how exactly.

The symptom appears to mean that when `react` is initialized, `Symbol` polyfill is not yet there, but when `react-dom` is initialized, the `Symbol` polyfill has already run. This would cause them to not recognize each other. Can you check if this is correct, and why this might be happening?",2021-01-15T15:47:23Z
761020349,"Check the compiled code. I wonder if TS is inserting an import to `react/jsx-runtime` _before_ other imports, which would cause the polyfill to run too late.",2021-01-15T15:48:40Z

The upstream solution is to move the order of the imports, I think. I.e. make the transform put the JSX import last. Can you file an issue in Babel to discuss this?",2021-01-15T17:15:37Z

> TBH, I cannot imagine a real use case that would need a hook function inside a non-react class. Implementing things this way may lead to confusion by new contributors to the codebase, needlessly making the learning curve steeper.

I think a regular class does very little to confuse people – it's traditional JavaScript syntax. If the user understands hooks already, I don't think `instance.useThing(…)` is a steeper learning curve than `useThing(…)`. I *do* think working around a linter by moving methods outside the class could lead to confusion, though, so of course it would be nicer for the linter to allow defining hook methods in non-React component classes. But I think we're mostly theorizing here, so I can only speak for the use case at my company where we use these extensively.

I can also tell you about a real use case that we're actively using across our entire React codebase, which led to my comment in the first place:

```javascript
// (Very simplified to save space.)
export class FeatureSet {
    #activeConfig
    #listeners = new Map()
    constructor(config) {
        this.#activeConfig = { ...config }
    }
    update(changes) {
        for (const name in changes) {
            const variant = changes[name]
            this.#activeConfig[name] = variant
            const set = this.#listeners.get(name)
            if (!set) continue
            set.forEach(listener => listener(variant))
        }
    }
    useCondition(name, condition) {
        // This is a pretty involved hook that is hydration aware among other things
        // and uses internal state of FeatureSet so it would not be nice to move it out.
    }
    // more methods for inspecting state, adding listeners, etc
}

// Example use

// In some shared module:
const experiments = new FeatureSet({ checkoutEncouragement: ""off"" })

// In some app logic somewhere:
experiments.update({ checkoutEncouragement: ""on"" })

// Component:
function BuyButton() {
    const encourageUser = experiments.useCondition(""checkoutEncouragement"", v => v === ""on"")
    return <button>{encourageUser ? ""BUY NOW!"" : ""Continue""}</button>
}
```

This is pretty much how we use it, overly simplified of course. We have multiple types of feature sets (tracking platform, active features based on user profile, and experiments for testing). The class tracks several internals such as realtime updates to the current state, and also tracks build-time state for effective hydration of the application.

This could of course all be rewritten to use some singleton store that has functions accessing it, but it's not the ideal way to write it, and I see little reason to go to such efforts to appease a linter.",2021-01-15T19:54:02Z

  // Wait for our check-for-updates poll to get the new data.
  jest.runOnlyPendingTimers();
  await Promise.resolve();

  expect(inspectedElement.props).toMatchInlineSnapshot(`
    Object {
      ""a"": 2,
      ""b"": ""def"",
    }
  `);

  done();
});
```

The bit that waits for the check-for-updates poll works, in that– new data comes in and I refresh the cache, but that update never goes anywhere. React doesn't re-render `<Suspender>` afterward and so my test fails.

Interestingly the test passes if I include both of the following after the `ReactDOM` update render:
```js
// Wait for our check-for-updates poll to get the new data.
jest.runOnlyPendingTimers();
await Promise.resolve();

await utils.actAsync(
  () =>
    renderer.update(
      <Contexts
        defaultSelectedElementID={id}
        defaultSelectedElementIndex={0}>
        <React.Suspense fallback={null}>
          <Suspender target={id} />
        </React.Suspense>
      </Contexts>,
    ),
  false,
);
```

But if I only include one of the two, the test fails. It seems like either one should be sufficient by itself.",2021-01-15T21:25:30Z
761205321,"Hey!

We are seeing this issue being reported in Headless UI, (https://github.com/tailwindlabs/headlessui/issues/194).
I made a reproduction in codesandbox that showcases the issue for React 17.

- React reproduction: https://codesandbox.io/s/angry-wing-k4lif?file=/src/App.js
- Vanilla js expectation: https://codesandbox.io/s/currying-cache-mtso0?file=/src/index.js

I noticed that there was a PR for this (https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/17909), but the PR got closed because it had been reported as a bug for Mozilla https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/17909#issuecomment-579449775

However, I am seeing this issue in the following browsers (all tested on macOS Big Sur):

- Safari - Version 14.0.1 (16610.2.11.51.8)
- Brave - Version 1.18.75 Chromium: 87.0.4280.101 (Official Build) (x86_64)
- Google Chrome Canary - Version 89.0.4389.0 (Official Build) canary (x86_64)

What would be the next steps? Is there anything you want me to do (re-open that PR for example)?",2021-01-15T21:25:32Z
761213755,Okay. That test is still not great and I'd love to get input on how to resolve it. Otherwise I think this PR is ready for another set of eyes!,2021-01-15T21:42:32Z

761574705,"Hey @LazarPetrovic1,

That should work normally. Could you show us an example of what you are doing?

If your code is looking similar to this example:

```js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';
 
export const App = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState({ hits: [] });
 
  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const result = await axios(
        'https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?query=redux',
      );
 
      setData(result.data);
    };
 
    fetchData();
  }, []);
 
  return (
    <ul>
      {data.hits.map(item => (
        <li key={item.objectID}>
          <a href={item.url}>{item.title}</a>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

This example is from this blog: [How to fetch data with React Hooks?](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-hooks-fetch-data). It will probably solve the issue you are describing here.",2021-01-16T14:43:09Z
761591072,"The code above looks over-engineered to me. I’d recommend checking out this article: [Tidy TypeScript: Avoid traditional OOP patterns](https://fettblog.eu/tidy-typescript-avoid-traditional-oop/). You can also check out how [apollo-client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client) or [react-query](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-query) are implemented. In short, they have class-based stateful cores with clean class-free react hooks around them.",2021-01-16T16:24:59Z

762484120,"Thanks for the repos @RobinMalfait.

Looks like the browser is firing the click event for the span in both the React and Vanilla examples. The difference is, React bubbles that click up to the button, which it shouldn't do according to [the spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-control-infrastructure.html#concept-fe-disabled):

> A form control is disabled if... The element is a descendant of a fieldset element whose disabled attribute is specified, and is not a descendant of that fieldset element's first legend element child, if any... A form control that is disabled must prevent any click events that are queued on the user interaction task source from being dispatched on the element.

I've added a test for this in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/20612 which should be failing. Unfortunately, a bug in JSDOM prevents click events from firing on _any_ child of a disabled fieldset (see [here](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom/blob/master/lib/jsdom/living/helpers/form-controls.js#L37-L44)), so the test passes in our test suite.

I believe the handling should be added somewhere around [here](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/376d5c1b5aa17724c5fea9412f8fcde14a7b23f1/packages/react-dom/src/events/getListener.js#L67) but @gaearon @trueadm or @sophiebits may have more context.

@dimaqq do you want to put in a PR to fix it? You should be able to just change `newChild` to `Object.prototype.toString.call(newChild)` in the three or so places that this error is thrown.

That change would result in this message:

762506540,"Hey @ievgennaida, thanks for the suggestion.

You can set the initial value of the state to the default value you want in a controlled component.

And I tried reproducing it with React Hooks and no errors popped up.",2021-01-18T23:07:06Z
762511250,"Hey @eric-burel, thanks for submitting the issue.

By design, `react-test-renderer` doesn't use a browser environment or JSDOM, so it's not possible to provide an `attachTo` feature to attach to an element.

If you're using Jest in a JSDOM environment, you can use ReactDOM directly as in:

```js
import ReactDOM from ""react-dom"";
import { Map, TileLayer } from ""react-leaflet"";

let div = document.createElement('div');
document.body.appendChild(div);

ReactDOM.render(
  <Map>
    <TileLayer
      attribution='&copy; <a href=""http://osm.org/copyright"">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors'
      url=""https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png""
    />
  </Map>
, div);
```

But I would recommend using a DOM testing library like [react-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) if this is something you want to do.


See the [Jest DOM Testing guide](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/tutorial-react#dom-testing) for more info.",2021-01-18T23:23:18Z

762513604,"@Singha360 thanks for the info!

I'm going to close this until there's a vanilla React reproduction case since, as you said, this works when using just React hooks.",2021-01-18T23:33:27Z
762523813,"@rickhanlonii Author of Hookstate is here. Hookstate uses two React hooks underneath useState and useEffect. There is no other special magic except specially maintained hash map to efficiently identify and notify (via a call to setState coming from React.useState) components affected by state change. This hash map gives React extraordinary performance boost, which you may not be seen before; see this demo of 10000 cells table state re-rending update to 1 cell every single millisecond - https://hookstate.js.org/docs/performance-frequent-updates. 

In relation to the reported bug. I disagree it was closed. And I am reopening it for the following reasons:

1. The bug happens with ONLY vanilla react hooks as Hookstate uses only vanilla react and 2 vanilla react hooks.
2. If you do not like the fact that there is a dependency to Hookstate, then copy index.ts from Hookstate to your project and use this instead of the Hookstate lib, and it will cause the crash in development tools. Would you like me to create such a reproducer repo for you?
3. Also, aren't you concerned that the crash stack trace points to the react dev tools code? I would thought that the code should be robust to the input it receives from various apps.
4. Moreover, the bug is reproducible if you simply add `React.useState(0)` - vanilla react hook - line to the sample React app: https://github.com/avkonst/hookstate/tree/master/docs/demos/todolist

762554475,"> Does using **useMemo** on _blockA_ and _blockB_ child components from the first example, prevent its rerender?

No. That memoizes the JSX and can have a similar effect to `memo`. But it doesn't provide any sort of unique ID to the tree and React will not move the tree when it changes parents.",2021-01-19T02:08:00Z

Whenever you want to update state based on the current state, you should use [functional state updates](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#functional-updates).

I applied this pattern to your codesandbox and it seems to result in the expected behavior: https://codesandbox.io/s/usestate-object-infinite-loop-forked-dk7vv

@eps1lon That comment was referring to [this](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/20548#issuecomment-761205309) which is different.

Your findings with the inline snapshot are interesting though. So the real issue was the `async -> done()` callback? (Obviously the date formatting issue but that's separate.) Maybe we can discuss the pros and cons of that in a follow up PR :)

762970883,"Ok, read this whole thread, didn't find what I was hoping to find: away to tell *React* to **NOT** use **passive event** on a specific element, or at least some way to tell *React* to bind a specific event on that element instead of on the root element (as a delegated event)

So, I want to stop the page from scrolling while the wheel (mouse for that matter) is being used over a specific range input field (`<input type=""range""/>`) and I hacked it like so:

https://stackoverflow.com/a/65795791/104380

Here's my copied answer from stackoverflow:

```js
const wheelTimeout = useRef()

const onWheel = e => {
    // ... some code I needed ...

    // while wheel is moving, do not release the lock
    clearTimeout(wheelTimeout.current)

    // flag indicating to lock page scrolling (setTimeout returns a number)
    wheelTimeout.current = setTimeout(() => {
      wheelTimeout.current = false
    }, 300)
}

// block the body from scrolling (or any other element)
useEffect(() => {
    const cancelWheel = e => wheelTimeout.current && e.preventDefault()
    document.body.addEventListener('wheel', cancelWheel, {passive:false})
    return () => document.body.removeEventListener('wheel', cancelWheel)
}, [])
```

Where `onWheel` is a callback for `<input type=""range"" wheel={onWheel} />`",2021-01-19T16:46:42Z

763044646,"I can reproduce this failure in a unit test btw:
```js
it('should gracefully handle custom hooks that have the same name as primitive hooks', async done => {
  let inspectedElement = null;
  function Suspender({target}) {
    inspectedElement = useInspectedElement(target);
    return null;
  }

  const container = document.createElement('div');

  function useState() {
    React.useState(0);
    React.useEffect(() => {});
  }

  function HooksNamingConflict() {
    useState();
    React.useState(0);
    return null;
  }

  await utils.actAsync(() =>
    ReactDOM.render(<HooksNamingConflict />, container),
  );

  const id = ((store.getElementIDAtIndex(0): any): number);
  await utils.actAsync(
    () =>
      TestRenderer.create(
        <Contexts
          defaultSelectedElementID={id}
          defaultSelectedElementIndex={0}>
          <React.Suspense fallback={null}>
            <Suspender target={id} />
          </React.Suspense>
        </Contexts>,
      ),
    false,
  );
  expect(inspectedElement.hooks).toMatchInlineSnapshot(`
    Array [
      Object {
        ""id"": 0,
        ""isStateEditable"": true,
        ""name"": ""State"",
        ""subHooks"": Array [],
        ""value"": 1,
      },
    ]
  `);

  done();
});
```

Seems like a few things are required:
* Custom hook with the same name as built-in hook.
* Custom hook calls both the same name built-in hook _and_ at least one other built-in hook.
* React component calls both the custom hook and at least one other built-in hook.

Anyway now that I have a repro should be easy enough to track down and fix between meetings today. 😄 

**Edit** Can repro this with an even smaller test:
```js
it('should gracefully handle custom hooks that have the same name as primitive hooks', () => {
  function useState() {
    React.useState(0);
    React.useEffect(() => {});
  }

  function HooksNamingConflict() {
    useState();
    React.useMemo(() => 0, []);
    return null;
  }

  ReactDebugTools.inspectHooks(HooksNamingConflict, {});
});
```",2021-01-19T18:42:55Z

I think it would do the same as the dev-tools do now - allowing to change a property on a object ""on the fly"".

> I've designed the props/state/hooks editable interface to work like Chrome's style editor in the Elements panel. I think this is a pretty familiar interface for most web developers. That panel allows you to start editing by focusing on either a key or value field.

I think that it is a valid point, however the Elements panel does not support a tree view like the Debug and dev-tools does. 

Further I will argue that it seems a little off that the user is able to click on a value of a object and see it expanded vs. not enable editing it like the primitive values (strings, numbers, etc.). ",2021-01-20T12:19:01Z

This check in `findPrimitiveIndex` is what causes the ""primitive index"" to advance too far if a custom hook name matches the current built-in hook.

Comments above suggest that this is intentional, to handle wrappers added by packagers with the same name:
https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/a511dc7090523ee49ce21a08e55c41917d8af311/packages/react-debug-tools/src/ReactDebugHooks.js#L431-L432

Unfortunately we don't have any test coverage for that case 😦 I can disable the lines above and my newly added tests pass (as well as all previous tests) but I suspect this just means we don't have a good integration test case.

I'm not sure how to differentiate between a packager-added wrapper and a user-added custom hook. Is there even a way?",2021-01-20T15:06:10Z

But this would have two downsides:
* It would mask the underlying error.
* It would hide some of the hooks information.

Consider the following component example:
```js
function useState() {
  React.useState(0);
  React.useEffect(() => {});
}

function HooksNamingConflict() {
  useState();
  React.useMemo(() => 0, []);
  return null;

```

We should see a hooks tree of:
* State (custom)
  * State (actual)
  * Effect
* Memo

With the above fix we would only see a reported tree of:
* State (actual)
* Memo

763830456,"Thanks for the report.

A couple of notes about your reprop:
`key={this.makeid(5)}` means that on every render you're creating a new `key`. `render` needs to be side-effect free 
Incidentally, this issue leads to will lead to Parent catching twice because you're rendering inside `StrictMode` which means React calls your render twice, you mount `Child` twice (because the `key` changes between `render`), call `componentDidMount` twice therefore throw two errors.

>  which will fall back to the next child in a specified list and attempts to render that

I'm not seeing that in your repro. I can only imagine that you have something like `<Parent fallbacks={[<A />, <A trySomethingDifferent={true} />]} />`. If React re-renders with `<A trySomethingDifferent={true} />` it will compare it against the previous configuration and note that the types are equal (`A === A`). It will then only update the previous instance of `A`. However, if `A` only threw in `componentDidMount` `<A trySomethingDifferent={true} />` will not throw again because it's already mounted.

~If you want to make sure that every fallback is mounted, you can wrap it in a `Fragment` and change the key. For example, `<React.Fragment key={this.state.fallbackCount}>{this.props.fallbacks[this.state.fallbackCount]}</React.Fragment>`~ Strike-through text doesn't seem to work (https://codesandbox.io/s/amazing-architecture-07zy6?file=/src/App.js). I suspect the behavior is not supported considering 

> In the event of an error, you can render a fallback UI with componentDidCatch() by calling setState, but this will be deprecated in a future release. Use static getDerivedStateFromError() to handle fallback rendering instead.

-- https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#componentdidcatch

Access to the current state in `getDerivedStateFromError` is already requested in https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13954",2021-01-20T18:04:05Z
763842541,"Hi, @eps1lon thanks for getting back to me so quickly.

Ah yes, the addition of the key was an attempt to ensure that it would be considered a new component each time. I've removed it from the example.

Yes sorry, I aimed for the example to be as simple as possible, I've updated it now to include an array of children which are then iterated over when rendered. It does seem that regardless of where in the lifecycle the error is thrown that it is only ever caught once, without making a more complex example it's difficult to show the behaviour but it is seen clearly if the error is thrown from the render method, does that still mean that it is the type comparison that is the cause. For reference, the patch we have implemented temporarily is to unique the child array before we attempt to render so we avoid this issue.

I did wonder if this behaviour was unsupported if so that is no problem at all, we can investigate into like getDerivedStateFromError.",2021-01-20T18:24:38Z

outcome we could get really...

764764479,"I am having a similar problem and I believe this is a bug in react dev tools. I am using a component which has no props but is using useContext inside (new context, not the legacy one). However in react-dev-tools the message is ""The parent component rendered.""
I think this is the exact case described here: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/19732",2021-01-21T16:21:27Z

764878815,"I don't think there's a bug here. You can reproduce the same behavior with vanilla DOM:

https://codesandbox.io/s/immutable-wildflower-w82nx?file=/src/index.js

```js
document.getElementById(""app"").innerHTML = `
<button id=""btn"">
  click me
</button>
`;
document.getElementById(""btn"").onclick = function () {
  document.addEventListener(""click"", function () {
    alert(""document click fired"");
  });
};
```

If you add a document listener *during* a button click, then that listener will fire (as a part of that click propagating upwards).

This didn't happen in React <17 because React used to register its events at the document level. So React handlers would run too late (when the event has already bubbled to the document level), and thus registering another document-level listener would not have a consequence. But React 17 behaves closer to how regular DOM works.",2021-01-21T19:22:19Z

764894678,"I have had this issue too, so posting my situation/solution in case it helps others. The issue I encountered came in a custom React Library I was building, but was pulling into a sample application in order to test in the browser easily. When I tried to add a custom hook, I kept getting the ""Two versions of React"" error...which is probably what is bringing anyone to this Issue.

In order to connect the sample app with the package, I had `nameofpackage: file:..` in my package.json. This allows npm to pull in the package into the node_modules of the application. I am using webpack to create the `dist/` files. And I kept getting that ""two versions of react"" error. I found that webpack has a property you can define `externals` that tells webpack to NOT bundle whatever you define in your dist. So I added React and React-dom, it seemed to work, but ran into issues with production and development....and testing.

After trying every combination of things, it seemed nothing would work for Dev, Prod and Testing. So in the package.json ""scripts"" block, I had 
`""test"":  ""karma start --single-run --browsers Chrome"",` I ended up with this:
`""test"": ""NODE_ENV=testing karma start --single-run --browsers Chrome"",`

By adding that `NODE_ENV=testing` I can then conditionally set the `externals` in the webpack file.

The problem was the Production and Development builds need to specifically NOT bundle React and React-dom, but since in the testing env, there are no other copies of react/react-dom, you need to allow them.

I am not saying this is the best solution, but I think it describes the situation I experienced, and at least allowed me to get something working so that I can work on something else.",2021-01-21T19:48:42Z
764904658,"Hey @zcaudate, thanks for submitting the request.

Since we're a small team and there's a huge community of transforms and bundlers, we're not able to own creating integrations for every library. Our approach is to document the API, provide an example plugin via Babel, and help the community implement Fast Refresh into their own ecosystem. If it meets the API spec and covers all supported use cases, then it is considered ""officially"" supported.

For that reason, the issue you created in Sucrase is best to track this work. To do the integration, please see the docs [here](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/16604#issuecomment-528663101) and reference the Babel plugin [here](https://github.com/alangpierce/sucrase/blob/master/src/transformers/ReactHotLoaderTransformer.ts).

764919780,"Hi @gaearon and thanks for taking your time to help me figure this out. Yes, i saw in the release notes that the listener was moved to the app root rather than keeping it at the document level, so i would expect things to bubble (and i know i can work around this by stopping propagation), but the weird thing to me is that, in my head, the effect in `Modal` shouldn't even have been run yet. And this behavior only happens when `useSortBy` is passed to `useTable`, otherwise the propagation works as i would expect.

To me it looks like:
1. On line 33 `setOpen` is called, the click handler returns immediately after `setOpen`, i then expect the click event to continue bubbling up and first after this process has finished should any other tasks in the event loop be handled.
2. The `setOpen` of step 1 queued a re-render of the `App` component, so it is run again and now `open` is actually set to true
3. At this point `Modal` will be mounted and renders a div with the contents ""my component""
4. The `useEffect` of `Modal` is then run, calling `document.addEventListener`
5. By this stage the click-event, in my eyes, is long gone and already handled and propagated, but my handler for `document.addEventListener('click', ...)` is called, causing `handleClick` to be run which in turn does `setOpen(false)` and hides the modal immediately

Maybe there is something asynchronous going on which i am missing. I'm using the Chrome debugger and seeing that the handler of my `addEventListener` call is being called immediately leaves me to think that event propagation was delayed somehow?

To continue on your vanilla example: (run here: https://codesandbox.io/s/falling-tdd-0tthx?file=/src/index.tsx):

```
document.getElementById(""app"").innerHTML = `
<button id=""btn"">
  click me
</button>
`;
document.getElementById(""btn"").onclick = function () {
  setTimeout(() => { // mimic async behavior of setOpen
    document.addEventListener(""click"", function () {
      alert(""document click fired"");
    });
  }, 0);
};
```

If we add a `setTimeout` to the `onclick`, mimicing the asynchronous operation react does when using the setter of `useState`, the event listener will not fire immediately, because the event bubbling will finish before next task of the event loop is picked up. Again, i'm a bit on thin ice here and maybe i'm making some wrong assumptions.

Regarding the library i don't think i need it in my case (i'm using a small little `useBackdrop` hook) If i just add a `event.stopPropagation()` to my hook i'm all good, but my curiosity is getting the better of me - in my mind this shouldn't be needed in the first place.

EDIT: Of course, this is all based on that `setState` from `const [state, setState] = useState(...)` is asynchronous, which i guess with fiber and all might not always be true(? again on thin ice) But even so it it is interesting why it happens only when i pass `useSortBy`. I tested adding `useFilters` instead, and same is true there so maybe it's not the actual ""plugin"", but whatever happens when a plugin is added to `useTable`",2021-01-21T20:33:57Z
764924428,"Here is a fork of the original codesandbox without passing `useSortBy` to the `useTable` hook (but really the entire `Table` component could be removed now as it serves no purpose) - as you can see it works perfectly fine. So it'd be interesting to see whatever in `useSortBy`  causes the propagation of the click event to be delayed.

It would help us a lot if you can share one of those apps. As minimal as possible until you can no longer reproduce the error. ""all apps that I open"" is a bit ambiguous since all the apps you did open might use a specific React API that causes this issue.",2021-01-22T08:22:39Z

Okay. I wasn't sure since my recollection was that it seemed like the recursive methods didn't actually cause performance problems. I'll post a follow up PR.",2021-01-22T13:55:15Z

765584678,"Ran into this issue today as well. Unfortunately, React's `onBeforeInput` event is really more like `onBeforeInsert`. It doesn't fire for deletions, formatting, etc. See [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/input-events-2/#interface-InputEvent-Attributes) for a full list of `inputType` values.

It's likely that changing the behavior to match the spec would break a bunch of existing React components that rely on `onBeforeInput` only being for insertions. Perhaps it makes sense to rename the existing event to something else in the next major version, and make `onBeforeInput` map to the native event? This way at least existing code could simply run a codemod to change to the legacy event name without also needing to handle when `e.data` is `null`. Alternatively, the old event could be dropped completely, but perhaps it's still useful given browser support for the native event is not perfect yet.",2021-01-22T17:54:50Z

765621225,"@devongovett It's something I thought long and hard about, especially as I'm currently working on a text editor at Facebook and obviously want to leverage the benefits of `beforeinput`.

It's more likely that we'd add support to React for `beforeinput` when FF ships stable support for `beforeinput`, as it's the last major browser that doesn't have support for it (although, hopefully it will soon thanks to the work done by @masayuki-nakano!). It would also have to be under a different alias, like you mentioned, such as: `unstable_onBeforeInput`. We'd switch the names around in React 19, giving folks plenty of time to plan for the change.",2021-01-22T18:59:50Z

Although I understand the intuition, what it's supposed to be is `useSelectedContextValue` which is too long.

I think this is better, we can easily bail in/out of the selector functionality anytime.

Could also imagine the API being like this:

```tsx
declare function useContext<T>(ctx: Context<T>): T;
declare function useContext<T, R>(ctx: Context<T>, selector: (value: T) => R, isEqual?: (prev: R, next: R) => boolean): R;

766633581,"It took a few hours of my life so I'm sharing my setup: **lerna** monorepo + **peer dependencies**.

### Initial state

```json
// ./packages/aaa/package.json
{
    ""name"": ""@company/aaa"",
    ""version"": ""1.0.0"",
    ""peerDependencies"": {
        ""react"": ""*"",
        ""react-dom"": ""*""
    }
}

// ./packages/bbb/package.json
{
    ""name"": ""@company/bbb"",
    ""version"": ""1.0.0"",
    ""dependencies"": {
        ""@company/aaa"": ""^1.0.0"",
        ""react"": ""^17.0.0"",
        ""react-dom"": ""^17.0.0""
    },
    ""devDependencies"": {
        ""@types/react"": ""^17.0.0"",
        ""@types/react-dom"": ""^17.0.0""
    }
}
```

So this gave me 2 instances of React in `@company/bbb` package, despite having properly configured `externals` in webpack config of `@company/aaa` package.

The solution that worked for me was to move `react` & `react-dom` to `dependencies` (works in `devDependencies` too, but I'm not publishing the `@company/aaa` package, so maybe it's better to put it in dependencies) in root `package.json` (and `@types/react` & `@types/react-dom` to `devDependencies` in root `package.json`) :man_shrugging:

### Final state

```json
// ./packages/aaa/package.json
{
    ""name"": ""@company/aaa"",
    ""version"": ""1.0.0"",
    ""peerDependencies"": {
        ""react"": ""*"",
        ""react-dom"": ""*""
    }
}

// ./packages/bbb/package.json
{
    ""name"": ""@company/bbb"",
    ""version"": ""1.0.0"",
    ""dependencies"": {
        ""@company/aaa"": ""^1.0.0""
    }
}

// ./package.json
{
    ""name"": ""company"",
    ""version"": ""1.0.0"",
    ""dependencies"": {
        ""react"": ""^17.0.0"",
        ""react-dom"": ""^17.0.0""
    },
    ""devDependencies"": {
        ""@types/react"": ""^17.0.0"",
        ""@types/react-dom"": ""^17.0.0""
    }
}
```

767432030,"@JadeLiuYC Could you include a real-world example? I don't see a reason why you can't use existing patterns to cancel async state updates:

```diff
  useEffect(() => {
+   let cancelled = false;
    setTimeout(() => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        let arr = [];
        for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
          arr.push({
            id: i + 1,
            text: `useEffect内异步请求下设置state警告问题${i + 1}`,
          });
        }
+       if (!cancelled) {
          setData(arr);
+       }
      }, 2000);
    }, 200);
-   return () => {}
+   return () => {
+     cancelled = true;
+   };
  }, []);
```

Though with your particular example I would just use `clearTimeout`:

```diff
  useEffect(() => {
-   setTimeout(() => {
+   let timeoutID = setTimeout(() => {
-     setTimeout(() => {
+     timeoutID = setTimeout(() => {
        let arr = [];
        for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
          arr.push({
            id: i + 1,
            text: `useEffect内异步请求下设置state警告问题${i + 1}`,
          });
        }
        setData(arr);
      }, 2000);
    }, 200);
-    return () => {};
+    return () => {
+      clearTimeout(timeoutID);
+    }

767449071,"@Acidic9 
To be fair, it won't fix all the problem.
e.g. 
```javascript
React.useCallback(async ()=>{
    setState1(1);
    setState2(1); // likely batched, if 
    await Promise.resolve(2);
    setState1(3); // won't batched
    setState2(3); // won't batched
    await Promise.resolve(4);
    setState1(5);           //non batched
    await Promise.resolve(6);
    setState2(7);          // non batched
 }, []);
```

but at least React.useCallback could mitigate half of it, if they are going to it in the legacy mode without using anything unstable API.

Or it may helps some eslint rule to detect the problem.

I believe they want the blocking/concurrent mode in new React will eventually fix the cause.

767517461,"Huh, so this looks specific to _desktop_ Safari. Interesting.

As you said it looks like this is already fixed in next desktop Safari, but for now you can add this *before* your `ReactDOM.render` call to prevent the `wheel` listeners from getting attached:

```js
// Patch native addEventListener *before* ReactDOM.render call.
const addEventListener = Node.prototype.addEventListener;
Node.prototype.addEventListener = function(type, listener, options) {
  if (type === ""wheel"") {
    // Disable because of https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/20662
    // Note: this would disable any onWheel listeners.
    // You could also limit this to particular roots, e.g.
    // if (type === 'wheel' && this.id === 'root') { return }
    return;
  }
  return addEventListener.apply(this, arguments);
};
```

https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-ee3bcq?file=src%2Findex.js

This would, of course, disable all `onWheel` listeners in your app. You could change the condition to target just the root alone (like in the commented example, substitute `""root""` with your DOM root element ID) and then use native `addEventListener` in specific components where you need it.",2021-01-26T12:42:59Z

*However*, it is possible that there might be some ways to optimize the function itself. It could very well be possible that it has become slower since the initial implementation due to some accidental deopt or compiler behaivor. So if you want to make a synthetic benchmark to stress-test it, and look for optimization opportunities, that would be appreciated.",2021-01-26T13:49:43Z

767626848,"I think the core of this problem is here:
https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/a511dc7090523ee49ce21a08e55c41917d8af311/packages/react-debug-tools/src/ReactDebugHooks.js#L439-L444

This check in `findPrimitiveIndex` is what causes the ""primitive index"" to advance too far if a custom hook name matches the current built-in hook.

Comments above suggest that this is intentional, to handle wrappers added by packagers with the same name:
https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/a511dc7090523ee49ce21a08e55c41917d8af311/packages/react-debug-tools/src/ReactDebugHooks.js#L431-L432

Unfortunately we don't have any test coverage for that case 😦 I can disable the lines above and my newly added tests pass (as well as all previous tests) but I suspect this just means we don't have a good integration test case.

I'm not sure how to differentiate between a packager-added wrapper and a user-added custom hook. Is there even a way?",2021-01-26T15:37:20Z

767742142,"> The data- namespace was added for a reason though. There’s a difference between what you technically could do and what’s best practice. You can technically patch prototypes too but then you get contains/includes situations.

Naming variables in JavaScript is not the same as patching prototypes. There's no strong convention (let alone enforcement) in JavaScript that prevents your function from having a variable with any name (even if it shadows outer scope variables), or your class from having any property names.

On that similar vein, there's really no need to have a convention to prevent an element from having its own properties (or attributes), even if those shadow builtins (or apply supplemental behavior to builtins).

I would suggest that the only thing that needs to be enforced is to ensure that Custom Element authors can easily override types of intrinsic attributes (props) for their custom intrinsic elements, which is not currently the case (TypeScript has an error if the type of a new IntrinsicElement's prop doesn't match one already defined in DetailedHTMLProps).

767783530,"Ideally we'd know what the stack of the native frame is, like we do in getPrimitiveStackCache. The reason we don't know how many wrappers there are, is because we don't know exactly how the end user code ends up getting access to the dispatchers and how many indirections there are like a re-exporting function. One way we can know for sure is if there ever is another hook called in the same frame. Then it's not a simple wrapper. The problem is that we don't know that until after the fact. So the solution would be to mutate after the fact.

The runtime bug occurs because we assume that something is primitive if it's the leaf of the tree. This bug and the structural bug happens when we're pushing to the children of that hook.

I think we can detect when that is happening and readjust the tree as we're noticing this.

If the currently processing stack is a strict superset of the previously processing stack, that means that we're adding to the leaf. We should never be adding to the leaf because that would be adding a child of a primitive which makes it no longer a primitive.

I.e. if we don't end up popping anything here then something has gone wrong:

https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/a511dc7090523ee49ce21a08e55c41917d8af311/packages/react-debug-tools/src/ReactDebugHooks.js#L510

Not all should be common.

If this happen, we know that the previous row as not a true primitive. We can then adjust that by creating a new clone as part of its children and mark the parent as not-editable. I.e. we move the primitive one level below and turn the previous primitive into a custom hook that happens to be named the same. That way we're free to add more things to that shared parent.",2021-01-26T19:44:26Z

With the code that's in the failing test on this PR, we have a custom hook that calls two primitives. First the call to `useState`:
```
 prev stack:        stack:

                    React.useState 
                    React.useState 
                   [useState]        <- incorrect identified primitive call site
                    Component
                    ...
```

Then the call to `useMemo`:
```
 prev stack:        stack:

 React.useState     React.useMemo 
 React.useState    [React.useMemo]   <- correct identified primitive call site
[useState]          useState
 Component          Component
 ...                ...
```

I think you're saying that as of the point when `useMemo` is called, we can look at our current stack and the previous stack and determine that we were wrong about the primitive call site for `useState`.

But doesn't that rest on the assumption that the custom hook will always call more one primitive hook? Maybe that's uncommon enough that this would still be an improvement.

> I.e. if we don't end up popping anything here then something has gone wrong

Is that always true? We wouldn't pop anything for primitive hooks that are called directly (not counting any wrapper functions added by a packager).

Error: Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component. This could happen for one of the following reasons:
1. You might have mismatching versions of React and the renderer (such as React DOM)
2. You might be breaking the Rules of Hooks
3. You might have more than one copy of React in the same app

767823167,"> Is that always true? We wouldn't pop anything for primitive hooks that are called directly

I believe we pop at least once because the call location of the primitive should be different between the two. Once we push a primitive we also set the current levelChildren to be that of the primitive so we need to pop it to get the shared parent.

The case not covered by my proposal is something like this:

```
function useState() {
  useMemo(() => {})
  useState();
}
```

Where the second call is a strict subset.

I'm not sure what happens there. Maybe that already just works.

No previous/next should ever be a strict superset nor subset of its previous/next pair. There is always at least one difference. If there isn't, it probably means we hit these cases.",2021-01-26T20:57:50Z

767903968,"As you're likely aware — Concurrent Mode is experimental, and there are likely both more bugs, and more breaking changes coming. (E.g. an upcoming breaking change will make more stuff synchronous, which might end up resolving this.)

I think form libraries are completely within their rights to _not_ fix this because the bug is probably ours, and we explicitly don't recommend anyone writing stable software to rely on experimental features in production.

~I would've expected `expect(Scheduler).toHaveYielded(['Render: 0', 'Effect: 0']);` to pass after every `handleClick` but every second click only yields `['Render: 0']`~ Not sure why I expected this. We only commit with unchanged deps so we should never run the effect. Yielding on every click with `['Render: 0']` is the correct answer.

Could you either update the issue or the codesandbox so that we avoid potential confusion when the bug is reported for one version but the repro uses a different one?",2021-01-27T12:26:07Z
768258948,"Thanks for the report.

Without seeing the actual code I'm suspecting you return early in a function violating the [rules of hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html). Something like

```jsx
export default function App() {
  const [count, increment] = useReducer((n) => n + 1, 0);

  if (count === 0) {
    useEffect(() => {}, [count, count]);
  } else {
    useEffect(() => {}, [count]);
    useEffect(() => {}, []);
  }

  return <button onClick={increment}>click me</button>;
}
```

768395924,"Hey guys, I am experiencing this issue and can't figure out how to solve it.

I asked for help on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65922344/how-to-fix-react-invalid-hook-call-error-when-importing-npm-linked-component) but perhaps here is more suited.

This issue is taking a toll on me (and apparently, many others). Thanks for your help! 

# How to fix React “Invalid hook call” error when importing npm link(ed) component that depends on styled-components?

First, I added `react`, `react-dom` and `styled-components` to `peerDependencies` of npm link(ed) component (and removed these dependencies from `dependencies` and `devDependencies`).

Second, I used the [official](https://reactjs.org/warnings/invalid-hook-call-warning.html#duplicate-react) workaround to use `npm link` (which, in theory, should solve this issue).

> This problem can also come up when you use `npm link` or an equivalent. In that case, your bundler might “see” two Reacts — one in application folder and one in your library folder. Assuming `myapp` and `mylib` are sibling folders, one possible fix is to run `npm link ../myapp/node_modules/react` from `mylib`. This should make the library use the application’s React copy.

I use the following scripts to link and unlink peer dependencies (I run them from directory of npm link(ed) component).

```console
$ cat .env
PEER_DEPS_NODE_MODULES_PATH=/Users/sunknudsen/Code/sunknudsen/sunknudsen-website/node_modules

$ cat link-peer-deps.sh
#!/bin/sh

if [ -f .env ]
then
  export $(cat .env | sed 's/#.*//g' | xargs)
fi

npm link

npm link \
  $PEER_DEPS_NODE_MODULES_PATH/react \
  $PEER_DEPS_NODE_MODULES_PATH/react-dom \
  $PEER_DEPS_NODE_MODULES_PATH/styled-components

cd $PEER_DEPS_NODE_MODULES_PATH

npm link @sunknudsen/react-cms

printf ""%s\n"" ""Done""

$ cat unlink-peer-deps.sh
#!/bin/sh

if [ -f .env ]
then
  export $(cat .env | sed 's/#.*//g' | xargs)
fi

npm uninstall

npm uninstall -g react react-dom styled-components

path=""$PEER_DEPS_NODE_MODULES_PATH/@sunknudsen/react-cms""

if [[ -L ""$path"" ]]; then
  rm ""$path""
fi

printf ""%s\n"" ""Done""
```

The project that depends on npm link(ed) component does not appear to have `react`, `react-dom` or `styled-components` conflicts.

```console
$ npm ls react            
sunknudsen-website@0.0.1 /Users/sunknudsen/Code/sunknudsen/sunknudsen-website
└── react@17.0.1

$ npm ls react-dom

If that is the case, I don't think it's likely for us to target browsers as old as IE 9/10 for developer tooling and iteration. The developer tools for these browsers are very old and not commonly used.",2021-01-27T21:38:18Z

768890717,"I'll chip in here, as it would be really helpful for us too. In answer to the comments about 'you should either have it for the entire tree or not at all', it's very similar to the classic 'warnings as errors' debate in c++ compilers. Ideally you should fix all warnings in your code, as they are there for a reason. However sometimes there are warnings you fundamentally can't fix or disable.

You could argue that you should just tolerate warnings for those areas of code - they are there for a reason after all. However if lots of warnings are pumped out, they start to become noise, and human developers in the real world begin to miss/ignore genuine warnings.

A real world old school example I had on a team was implementing games that included the Nintendo Wii UI, which was a big set of c++ files provided by Nintendo packed full of warnings. Our whole code base had 0 warnings in except for that library. We couldn't modify it, as it was strictly enforced by the 3rd party, who had no intention of fixing it. In that scenario, the best solution for the team and the project was to disable warnings for the Nintendo code, so our team code focus on ensuring the rest of our code had 0 warnings.

This one is similar - in our case it's the bootstrap modal dialog. If every time it pops up you see a flood of errors, you stand a good chance of missing other errors in your own code. Counter intuitively, disabling those errors until we have a fixed bootstrap dialog will help us reduce bugs in our project, as genuine errors will be more obvious.

I understand that's not a solution for everybody, and some may prefer to be more strict. But for us and many other teams, we feel a simple <React.DisableStrictMode> to use in the worst case scenarios would improve the team's ability to catch bugs and reduce errors. Ultimately it should be a decision for the team, who understand their own use case the best.

769150265,"I don't think React would do anything to reload your page given the example code above. But can you share a full repro (code that we can run) that shows this happening?

Here's a Code Sandbox that's similar if you'd like a starting point:

769151686,"Suspense has a very specific and strict contract. It's not currently documented, which is why we're asking _not_ to build integrations with it except as an experiment. The examples above do not satisfy that contract.

Here's this contract in a nutshell. A Suspense-compatible cache should follow these rules:

- It returns the value (or throws an error) synchronously, if it’s fetched for the given key.
- It throws a Promise if a value is not fetched for the given key yet, and starts the fetch.
  - If data for the requested key is already being fetched, the same Promise must be thrown. (So the Promise itself is stored in the cache until it settles.)
  - When the Promise resolves, **the cache is updated with either the result (so that it can be read successfully next time), or an error (so that it is rethrown next time).**
    - Note that the Promise’s value is ignored by React. What matters is that we put the result into the cache so that React can read it during the retry.
  - The result is then cached. This cache is “append-only”: once we put the fetched data into the cache, we never mutate or remove it. (There is a separate mechanism for invalidation in React itself, which amounts to replacing the cache with an empty one.)

The bolded part explains that you're supposed to cache the errors, too. We'll document this contract when Suspense for data fetching is considered stable.",2021-01-28T15:12:01Z
769159660,"(It's still possible we'll offer a higher-level API that enforces these constraints, but I wanted to document the current state.)",2021-01-28T15:22:23Z
769165101,"We agree with the concerns that a flood of errors/warnings masks any single type of error (even one that may be more pressing) and teaches people to just ignore errors/warnings.

But let's take a step back and consider why you're using `<StrictMode>`. In case it's not clear, no one needs to use it. It exists for one very specific reason: to provide a signal about whether the part of an application it wraps around contains code that is _likely to cause problems in concurrent mode_ (aka our new `createRoot` API). If you are not planning to use `createRoot` in the near future then `<StrictMode>` doesn't add a lot of value to your application and you can just remove it for now.

Our team talks about things like this often so there's always a chance that we may reevaluate this decision (either the planned semantics of `createRoot` or the option to opt out of warnings for part of the subtree). We'll keep everyone posted if/when anything changes.",2021-01-28T15:30:06Z
769170124,"Well, if your honest answer is that we should simply turn it off, then I guess we can follow it.

I am  missing one piece of the puzzle. **How can we enable live reloads when hard linked files in `node_modules/hard-linked-package-name-goes-here` change?**.

The packages are hard linked in `node_modules` folder... I guess that folder is excluded by default (wasn't able to figure out where).

Curious, how does `react-scripts` listen for changes of packages that are npm link(ed)?

Another way of helping my project is to upvote https://stackoverflow.com/q/65940110/4579271, https://stackoverflow.com/q/65922344/4579271 and https://stackoverflow.com/q/65944182/4579271 on StackOverflow.

## Status update 1: it appears changes in `node_modules` are watched by default, but [inconsistently](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar/issues/1071) on macOS (perhaps on other operating systems too). According to some experiments, hard linked packages in `node_modules` appear to never trigger watch events.

##  Status update 2: given hard links are not watched by chokidar (might actually be related to how hard links work vs a bug), I deprecated [npm-hardlink](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-hardlink) in favor of [npm-sync](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-sync).

769711482,"@bvaughn I’ve just spent a month figuring out why ag-grid was leaking memory. 

Background: 

I found some code was passing api references to useCallback via deps. The apis are mutable, circular and attached as a property to the div element (mounted in their component). That same component calls “destroy” on that api when it is unmounted, but i don’t see any direct code removing that api reference from the DOM element. I originally called a setter on a context provider to set references to their api (for sharing across components), along with commonly used utility methods for stuff like resetting scroll, etc. 

Assumptions (Leak Culprits):

- stale closures from useCallback with references to the apis.
- mutable references to the apis on a top level component via context provider. 
- no way to destroy/cleanup references at context level, besides useUnmount; their destroy/cleanup getting executed via componentWillUnmount; they do not provide an onDestoy callback.

Solution?

- moved all calculated and context state to useReducer
- Used pure callbacks for dispatching actions to the reducer. 
- moved all api references used to calculate state to local useEventCallbacks (ref callback pattern)... calling said setters via actions.  
- used a hook in sibling components to access the api via useRef/DOM element prop; making sure to set reference to null on unmount. 

Questions:

- am I doing anything unnecessarily?
- is my assumption about useEventCallback for those local callbacks correct?
-  Would useCallback suffice? I’m pretty confident the way they are using callback props in their react component is mutating those references as well (plus circular). 
- is using a dom property reference in a hook safe? Would you need to set that reference to null when unmounting?
- When handling local state containing their apis, should I useRef because of the mutability? 
- Does useState/useReducer both have the same process/pattern as useRef in terms of destroying references when unmounting? 
- is manual cleanup necessary?",2021-01-29T10:10:37Z

769905057,"I'm sorry you experienced this bug! 🙇 

Looks like this problem was already reported though (#20431) so I'm going to mark this issue as a duplicate and close it. If you have additional context that might help us repro this problem, please leave a comment on the other issue!

**Extra repro cases would be very helpful for this issue in particular.*

Thank you~",2021-01-29T16:23:42Z
769925588,"@masayuki-nakano Have there been any updates or updates regarding this feature shipping? We're actively looking to adopt `beforeinput` internally at Facebook to power a new text editor that is under development and we're also keen to see how React can adopt this too.

We noticed that `getTargetRanges` works as expected in FF Nightly in many of our test cases. In fact, we actually found some bugs in Chromium (see https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1043564). We'll be reaching out to get this bug fixed, but it's reassuring to see that FF gets this right (great work!).

We're looking to ship this new feature by the end of this half, so any estimations would be great.",2021-01-29T16:59:21Z

In order to merge **any pull request** (code, docs, etc.), we **require** contributors to sign our **Contributor License Agreement**, and we don't seem to have one on file for you.

# Process

In order for us to review and merge your suggested changes, please sign at <https://code.facebook.com/cla>. **If you are contributing on behalf of someone else (eg your employer)**, the individual CLA may not be sufficient and your employer may need to sign the corporate CLA.

Once the CLA is signed, our tooling will perform checks and validations. Afterwards, the **pull request will be tagged** with `CLA signed`. The tagging process may take up to 1 hour after signing. Please give it that time before contacting us about it.

```js
function useMyHook(initialValue) {
  return React.useState(initialValue)
}

function MyComponent() {
  const [value, setValue] = useMyHook(0)

  return ""...""
}
```

The developer tools will display this as a `MyHook` with a `State` hook nested under it. It allows you to create a heading by simply grouping hooks in function names.

In production, it will tear silently without warning _or_ without throwing the error, because there's no double render that observes the mutation. It will cause a bug because of the tearing, but not immediately.

I think this is probably fine, since the same is true of other types of render-phase side-effects: the second render might throw even if the first one does not.

I'm only pointing it out because I wonder if we should start wrapping *all* of our double render calls in `try/catch`, suppress the error so it matches production, and fire a warning.

So essentially: we could generalize your fix here to all render-phase mutations that cause errors.",2021-01-30T19:41:14Z

After I posted this I started to second-guess myself because console messages are disabled during the double render, so how would your warning work...

... but then I remembered our *other* double invocation: the one that wraps the begin phase in `invokeGuardedCallback`.

So you actually do warn during the Strict Mode double render, but that one gets suppressed. The warning that doesn't get suppressed is the `invokeGuardedCallback` one.",2021-01-30T21:48:55Z

# Action Required

In order to merge **any pull request** (code, docs, etc.), we **require** contributors to sign our **Contributor License Agreement**, and we don't seem to have one on file for you.

# Process

In order for us to review and merge your suggested changes, please sign at <https://code.facebook.com/cla>. **If you are contributing on behalf of someone else (eg your employer)**, the individual CLA may not be sufficient and your employer may need to sign the corporate CLA.

770651939,"> We're actively looking to adopt beforeinput internally at Facebook to power a new text editor that is under development and we're also keen to see how React can adopt this too.

@trueadm Just curious, if that's no secret, are you working on something other than Draft.js that would be open-sourced at some point or is it purely an internal project?",2021-02-01T07:57:07Z
770697263,"@JanJakes Yes, I'm working on something other than Draft.js. I expect the project to be eventually open-sourced at some point too, although no guarantees or dates as it's too early :)",2021-02-01T09:06:04Z
770817319,"@jsamr I think it'd be better to move the reasonning down to an alternative `useCallback` implementation (and also provide an answer to #14099). This way the solution can be used for callbacks used in any context (DOM events, render callbacks ...) not just `useEffect` (or `useLayoutEffect`) ones. 

In all cases, the solution must take into account that `useEffect` can use dependencies indirectly, for example by referring to values returned by a `useCallback`.

The issue is that callabck dependencies play a double rule: 

   1. avoid the stale closure problem
   2. as a recative mechanism to trigger some output from react into the external world

In some case we want both 1 and 2 (like with render callbacks passed to a child Component). 

In other cases we want only 1: we just like to update the values seen by the callback. This is typically the case for callbacks that aren't invoked by React but some external notifier like DOM event handlers (unless the handler's code itself changes). React doens't control when those callbacks will be invoked, so it makes sense to always access latest committed state in this case. The solution usually is to close over a mutable ref (there's an ambiguity  for `setState` here, since functional setState could be applied to state that's possibly different from the committed one).

And finally a third (and the most subtle) kind is the `useEffect` callbacks which may combine both concerns. This corresponds to your motivating example.

A compiler can probably distinguish between callbacks scheduled by React and those invoked by the external world,  but the challenge is

   - for (2) did the function code itself actually changed or just the closure environment ?
   - for (3) how to distinguish between deps that must invalidate and deps that just update the closure?

A manual implementation could be done in user space as mentionned by @bvaughn but the lint rule seems unable to verify deps that aren't passed as an array literal.",2021-02-01T12:22:14Z
770830299,"For the next person finding this, this was added as a part of [`@types/react@16.9.20`](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/38390)",2021-02-01T12:45:26Z
770836948,"So my solution to avoid inconsistent state on the first render and a second render is using useMemo like this:

```
function useDerivedState<T>(propValue: T) {
  const [stateValue, setStateValue] = useState(propValue);
  const useStateValue = useRef(false);

  // useMemo run synchronously when deps changed
  useMemo(() => {
    useStateValue.current = false;
  }, [propValue]);

  const setValueCallback = useCallback((action: SetStateAction<T>) => {
    useStateValue.current = true;
    setStateValue(action);
  }, []);

  const currentValue = useStateValue.current ? stateValue : propValue;

  return [currentValue, setValueCallback] as const;
}
```

but the docs specify that useMemo API does NOT garantee that in the future it will run ONLY if deps changed.
Is there a safe way to do it or am I stuck with this hack until (and if one day) useState accepts deps?

edit: Nevermind I can store the deps in a ref and manually compare of course...",2021-02-01T12:56:29Z
770839486,Is this a regression from v17 or are you able to reproduce still with v16? If it is a regression then it could have the same root cause as https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/20662 (the way React attaches events has changed).,2021-02-01T13:01:00Z
770914131,Opened an internal Diff with an alternate way of adding this warning (via a wrapper around the create-root entry points).,2021-02-01T14:52:10Z
771050973,Closing in favor of the Facebook wrapper approach mentioned above.,2021-02-01T18:12:37Z
771113268,"The dispatcher is an internal data structure and overriding it externally is something we would intentionally discourage. The `__SECRET_INTERNALS_DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED` shouldn't be thought of as an ""export"", but as an internal field that isn't safe to use externally because it may change in ways that are not semver compatible.

Our suggestion for testing custom hooks is to test them by rendering a React component. Taking [the main example](https://github.com/davidmfoley/isolate-hooks#api) on the GitHub project you linked to, that could look something like this:
```js
// Custom hook you want to test
const useCounter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return [count, () => setCount((count) => count + 1)];
};

let increment;

// Wrapper component used to test hook
function Component(props) {
  const [count, setCount] = useCounter();
  increment = setCount;
  return count;
}

// Your test
const container = document.createElement(""div"");
ReactDOM.render(<Component />, container);

expect(container.textValue).toBe(""0"");

ReactDOM.act(() => {
  increment();
});

expect(container.textValue).toBe(""1"");
```",2021-02-01T19:49:41Z
771121486,The problem with that approach is that it requires 1) a virtual dom and 2) to create extra components for testing -- that's a lot of heavy machinery to require just to test a hook-based state machine that itself doesn't have any knowledge of a DOM. The dispatcher is effectively the handler for the various react hooks `useXxx` functions. Providing a way to inject an alternate dispatcher implementation (or providing another way to intercept calls to those hook functions) would make react hooks more testable.,2021-02-01T20:03:56Z
771122494,"> it requires 1) a virtual dom 

We publish a test renderer package as well, if you'd like to avoid using something like JSdom.

771123310,"> Throwing an error that's only thrown in DEV seemed weird to me (and still does)

Yeah I want to follow up on this topic because I do wonder if we should be catching these. Added to next meeting's notes.

> as does checking the console in this way

Yeah we can do this more explicitly, like by setting some global context variable. Went for this for now since it's how the mock Scheduler's yieldValue method detects it, too.",2021-02-01T20:07:05Z
771124315,"> Went for this for now since it's how the mock Scheduler's yieldValue method detects it, too.

Oh I actually didn't know that.",2021-02-01T20:08:47Z

`react-dom.development.js:6202 Unable to preventDefault inside passive event listener invocation.`

Therefore, with the latest version of React, this issue's title (**touchstart preventDefault() does not prevent click event.**) is still an issue.

771292736,"@guillaume86 I noticed that too (after my comment above) and made the same change 😂

Your solution is similar to mine, which has some interesting tweaks you might like:

- Putting all the internals (including the callback and the current value and the previous deps) into `ref.current` as an object.
- Doing so using `||=` so that object is only created once.
- If the initial value is an initialiser function, passing the deps array into it — this allows you to define a function _outside_ your component to set the initial state (and save creating a function on every render).

End result is it creates **zero** functions or objects on nth render, so performs extremely well. The slowest part is the loop to check if the deps have changed, which I suspect is why `useState()` doesn't do this itself.

```js
export const useLazyState = <T, D extends readonly unknown[]>(initialiser: T | ((...args: D) => T), deps: D): [T, SetStateAction<T>] => {
	const internals = (useRef<{ value: T; deps: D; setState: SetStateAction<T> }>().current ||= {
		value: initialiser instanceof Function ? initialiser(...deps) : initialiser,
		deps,
		setState: (value: T) => {
			internals.value = value;
			return setState(value);
		},
	});

	const setState = useState<T>(internals.value)[1];

	// Refresh value if the deps change.
	if (!isArrayEqual<D>(deps, internals.deps)) {
		internals.value = initialiser instanceof Function ? initialiser(...deps) : initialiser;
		internals.deps = deps;
	}

	return [internals.value, internals.setState];
};
```

771301771,"The main problem is to update data after asynchronous request. If the component is unloaded (switching pages, etc.), the above warning will appear. The official advice is to cancel the asynchronous request in the return function of useeffect. This does not solve practical problems.

The root causes of the above problems are as follows

1. If the asynchronous request does not return, you can cancel the asynchronous request in the return function;

2. If the request has returned, data processing is in progress, and the state is about to be updated, the above warning will also appear when the component is unloaded (switching pages, etc.). At this point, you need to set an unmounted variable to control the update of the state.",2021-02-02T02:24:34Z

771496023,"> If the request has returned, data processing is in progress, and the state is about to be updated,

If you're in a synchronous piece of code e.g. `then(() => { /* synchronous piece of code  */})`, the component cannot be updated during the execution of the synchronous piece of code and you won't get the described warning. You will only get the warning if it was unmounted between two ""blocks"" e.g.

```js
await fetch();
// ----- update can happen now. Next code needs to be cancelable.
await processData();
```
or
```js
fetch()
// ----- update can happen now. Next code needs to be cancelable.
  .then(() => {
    return processData()
  })
```

That's one of the reasons why `effectFn` `useEffect(effectFn)` cannot be async so that it can return a cleanup function before the component is unmounted.

So maybe you're doing something like

```js
useEffect(async () => {
  const response = await fetch(url);
  const rawData = await response.json();
  const data = await processData(rawData);
  setData(data);
}, [url])
```
where you can't cancel `processData` or `response.json()` if the component unmounted. But that's why you need to leverage `then()`, `catch()` and the other Promise methods.

The `getTransactions` functions needs to know if it is cancelled since it has multiple `await` instructions. In between the component could've been unmounted. I've done this by inlining the function into the effect handler. It should have the same functionality.

```js
useEffect(() => {
    let mounted = true;
    let URL = config.API_URL+""Transactions/getAll/""+page;
    fetch(URL)
      .then(response => response.json())

771572703,"Thanks for the report.

Your `useExternalState` hook has a side-effect during render: ` updaters.add(forceUpdate);`. Once you move it into the effect, batched and unbatched updates work consistent:
```diff
function useExternalState() {
  const forceUpdate = useReducer(v => v + 1, 0)[1];
- updaters.add(forceUpdate);
  useEffect(() => {
+   updaters.add(forceUpdate);
    return () => updaters.delete(forceUpdate);
  }, [forceUpdate]);
  return externalState;
}

> The issue on the zustand repo was closed. Why do you think this is an issue with React?

I wasn't really sure, but from what I could see the zustand issue was closed without a fix or any real conclusion whether it was a bug or expected behavior. So I reported it to see if someone here could shed any more light on it. As you pointed out it does look like it's caused by side-effects outside of `useEffect` so I guess it's not a bug after all, thanks again for pointing out the issue!",2021-02-02T13:48:00Z
771652401,">  But I can't say I understand how adding an extra listener (?) could cause the useEffect to not trigger. Or what is happening here?

It might be worth trying to figure this out and see if we can add a warning. In the end you're calling a version of `dispatch` that wasn't committed. But it's not clear if this would conflict with render phase updates.

Don't really have the time to dig into this though. I do understand how this particular issue with side-effects during render is tricky because it just silently produces unexpected output. Would be interesting to see if this can also happen with prod builds i.e. render twice, commit once due to a sibling suspending.",2021-02-02T13:58:12Z

> By understanding this article, setting a variable to control whether the update of state is an anti pattern?

I think the part about promises in that article is just a bit unfortunate. They're basically just abstracting the `isMounted` call into `makeCancelable`. 

The takeaway from this article is that you should cancel your async tasks in cleanup functions instead of wrapping every update in e.g. `isMountedRef.current`. For promises that does look like you're just re-implementing `isMounted`. But for e.g. timeouts you should use `clearTimeout` instead of wrapping the deferred update in `isMounted`. Generally, I'd say you should move your mental model from ""is mounted?"" to ""is cancelled?"". ""is mounted"" breaks down if you have effects with dependencies where the cleanup function doesn't necessarily run when the component unmounts.",2021-02-03T08:46:32Z

That PR only affected the `scripts/release/download-experimental-build.js` which I'm the only person who uses (and I tested it).

I am using NginX and did not have quite the correct settings for WordPress.

I have updated my Wiki and it is here:-

773201878,"@acdlite Is the goal to stop the failing job and all jobs that require it or can the jobs requiring `get_base_build` continue?

If you just want to exit `get_base_build` successfully and `sizebot` handles the missing base build gracefully you could use

```diff
command: |
+     set +e
      git fetch origin master
      cd ./scripts/release && yarn && cd ../../
      scripts/release/download-experimental-build.js --commit=$(git merge-base HEAD origin/master)
      mv ./build2 ./base-build
+     exit 0
```

`set +e` means the command won't immediately exit on the first error. The trailing `exit 0` ensures that the command exits with `0` regardless of the exit codes of the other scripts within that command.",2021-02-04T10:26:52Z
773232948,"Thanks for helping me find the actual problem, I'll close this issue now. I agree it would be nice with some sort of warning. 

>In the end you're calling a version of `dispatch` that wasn't committed. But it's not clear if this would conflict with render phase updates.

Which `dispatch` do you mean here? Do you have pointers to any resources for learning more about the internals of how this works. Would be fun to try and work out exactly what's happening, but think I have some knowledge gaps I need to fill first.",2021-02-04T11:19:23Z

773328100,"1. All state should be stored in the `useRef` of `useState` hooks.

```js
const someGlobalCache = new Map() // wrong
export function useMyHooks() {
    // do something with global cache
}
```

2. All states should be immutable (important!)

During the concurrent rendering, React will copy refs and states **by reference** (in my understanding). So any mutation will cause bugs in the concurrent mode.

```js
function useX() {
    const ref = useRef({})
    useEffect(() => {
        ref.current.xyz = 1 // Wrong!
        ref.current = { ...ref.current, xyz: 1 } // Safe
    })
}
```

773477995,"React only accepts immutable input. A one-shot iterator wouldn't be immutable and so is not supported. Only *iterables* that can produce multiple iterators over the same immutable input are supported.

A user space description of why this is important might be something like this:

```
function Foo({ menuItems: ... }) {
  let [state, ...] = useState(...);
  return menuItems.map(...);
}
``` 

This component itself might rerender multiple times without the parent doing so. Therefore if you pass a one-shot iterable in to this component - rerendering wouldn't work.

It'd suggest you explore Number.range returning an *iterable* that can produce multiple iterators over the same range since the input range is immutable. (I think we'd probably want to object to a collection approach that is one shot and not compatible with an immutable approach. Like you shouldn't need to use toArray for something like this since it's inefficient.)",2021-02-04T17:28:14Z

I don't know what you mean by this. If you mean the Cache, no, it should not be stored in either of these, because they get destroyed when Suspending before mount. We have some built-in helpers to hold the Cache coming later, but they're not a stable API yet.

773667880,"Hi,

I recently upgraded to v17.0. I really miss this feature, I used it while also displaying a redux dispatched action. I found this very useful to identify issues with unnecessary or duplicate renders as I would get a nice overview of what action I dispatched and all the components that rendered under it. The inaccurate timings were not an issue for me as once I identified an area that needed some work I would use other tools to drill into the problem.

Now I don't have a nice way to replicate this view. I can still see my dispatched timings and I can profile individual renders with the react profiler but I miss having a way to see what action caused a group of renders. Is there any other way to achieve this?",2021-02-04T23:20:31Z
773690533,"> What do you use reparenting for today?

I have a use case: A dashboard with widgets rendered in columns with drag & drop between them (using react-beautiful-dnd). 

Each column is a Droppable here and the individual widgets are the Draggable children of this Droppable.

The contents of each widget are completely dynamic and definitely stateful - each widget is pretty standalone and there can be many different kinds of them, so managing state on a higher level is impractical. For example, they can fetch data to display in charts, they can contain a search bar etc.

Reparenting is useful here because you clearly don't want to re-fetch data, or lose you search bar value, when switching columns.

Not saying there is absolutely no way around this, but yeah, a native way to reparent probably would be nice? :)",2021-02-05T00:18:12Z
773780968,"> It'd suggest you explore Number.range returning an iterable that can produce multiple iterators over the same range since the input range is immutable.

Yes, we explored this a lot but it's hard to change to iterable instead of one-shot iterator (see discussion in https://github.com/tc39/proposal-Number.range/issues/17, https://github.com/tc39/proposal-Number.range/issues/41 and https://github.com/tc39/proposal-Number.range/pull/42)",2021-02-05T04:34:21Z
773787430,"At the end of the day, with a reusable iterable you can always get a one-shot iterator out of it but you can't get a reusable out of a one-iterator except by allocating the full memory at which point the whole point of iterables are defeated.

React is a good example of a use case where you can't use a one-shot. It's a very common paradigm in JS.

Since you can't use a one-shot and toArray defeats the purpose, your only option will be to use a third party user space library. If this pattern is useful enough, it'll eventually get added to the language as the reusable iterable form.

So it seems inevitable that either there's two APIs or just reusable iterable.




",2021-02-05T04:54:50Z
773800223,"I definitely support the iterable but others don't agree.
And whatever semantic the range proposal choose, if you want to make it useful in React, it's must be used with iterator helper. And the iterator helper proposal doesn't work with iterable, it's always returned a one shot iterator. ",2021-02-05T05:32:12Z
773801859,Unfortunately there's nothing we can do to support it but we can create a more descriptive error message.,2021-02-05T05:36:18Z
773813812,"> Can we somehow detect a one-shot iterator? Maybe some check like `x[Symbol.iterator]() === x` should warn when true?

Since react consume the iterator twice, react can warn if the second consume doesn't get the same array length as the first consume",2021-02-05T06:06:00Z

773945843,"Thanks for the report.

Note that you get a warning about invalid DOM nesting for React 16 and 17.

The current behavior might've been broken in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/19333 but I can't speak to whether this was intentional or not and if the new behavior should stay. 

With native HTML the child will never be submitted but every submit button inside that form submits the parent: https://codesandbox.io/s/boring-goldwasser-67fsv?file=/public/index.html

@gaearon What do you think about the new behavior compared to ""native"" behavior?",2021-02-05T10:30:11Z

So is the above genuinely the simplest way to implement useMemo with a semantic guarantee safely?... surely all that complexity warrants inclusion in React itself or at least something in the React docs pointing to [`useMemoOne`](https://github.com/alexreardon/use-memo-one)?

Unless maybe I'm doing something wrong, however I find I need to perform [change detection on derived data](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66064561/change-detection-in-react) quite [often](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/issues/7059) 🤔.

I wonder if users are generally getting away with `useMemo` as a semantic guarantee which is why [`useMemoOne`](https://github.com/alexreardon/use-memo-one) is a little shy of React's 10 million weekly downloads 😅",2021-02-06T10:47:51Z
774470267,"Hey guys,

I was able to reproduce this issue with [very little code](https://github.com/sunknudsen/my-app/compare/react-picture-issue#diff-26ad4b834941d9b19ebf9db8082bd202aaf72ea0ddea85f5a8a0cb3c729cc6f2) added to a clean-install (`npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript`) of [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/#creating-a-typescript-app).

I created a [repo](https://github.com/sunknudsen/my-app) that can be used to debug this issue (please `git checkout  react-picture-issue`).

I also included a pre-rendered no-js file (see https://github.com/sunknudsen/my-app/blob/react-picture-issue/public/index-rendered-no-js.html) that confirms the issue is only present when the React JavaScript code is running.

To use `my-app` to reproduce the issue, please run the following:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/sunknudsen/my-app.git

$ cd my-app

$ git checkout react-picture-issue

$ npm install

$ npm start
```

To test React version, go to http://localhost:3000/ in Firefox and open developer tools at the network tab (notice the request to http://localhost:3000/static/media/test-1920x1080.png?).

To test no-js version, go to http://localhost:3000/index-rendered-no-js.html in Firefox and open developer tools at the network tab (notice how the request to http://localhost:3000/static/media/test-1920x1080.png is **not** present?).

774472591,"If this works, maybe we could use currently available lifecycle methods. Methods would return true if they requested some data and rerender would be required. SSR then could work this way:

1. The `componentDidMount` method will be called first - before render - instead of `beforeServerSideRender`.
2. If method call is resolved with `true` it means, it fetched some data, some `setState` was called and based on new state it will be updated again. If method returns false, Proceed with step 4.
3. The `componentDidUpdate` method will be called in a loop with condition by it`s return - proceed with step 2.
4. When methods return false, no more ""rerenders"" are needed so we can do final render - really call `inst.render()` and finish.

So the code could be like this:
```js
const needUpdate = inst.componentDidMount && await inst.componentDidMount();
if(inst.componentDidUpdate)
{
    while(await inst.componentDidUpdate(/* not sure how to get prevProps, prevState*/));
}
child = inst.render();
```

It might nicely solve a giant problem with SSR.",2021-02-06T12:47:53Z

you can delete the static variable from the wrapped class and keep the static property in the innerComponent only
for example:
you can assign static variable like this:
`IssueRowPlain.contextType = UserContext;`
wrap the component
`const IssueRow = withRouter(IssueRowPlain);`
then delete the static variable from result wrapped component
`delete IssueRow.contextType; `

I understand the difference/significance between user-blocking events like `click` and `mousemove`, but conceptually it seems like there's also an important difference between events like `load` (which seems discrete) and `progress` (which seems continuous) so it seems odd to me to see those collapsed into one category of ""default"".",2021-02-08T14:53:32Z

I guess I've never _fully_ understood parts of our event stuff, and since it seems like we're moving to simplify/clarify it, I thought I'd ask why we only have 3 categories (instead of a matrix of user-blocking vs not and continuous vs discrete).",2021-02-08T14:57:31Z

I see. One thing I'm still a little confused about (and feel free to tell me to just read the code) is the expected behavior for events that are _conceptually_ both non-user-blocking _and_ continuous.

775449674,"Heh, a fair question. In my case, I needed it in order to support generics for a hook that helps manage state for asynchronous calls like mutations:

```
export function useAsyncAction<F extends (...args: unknown[]) => Promise<R>, R>(
  doAction: F,
): [
  doActionWithState: F,
  isDoingAction: boolean,
  errorDoingAction: unknown | null,
  clearErrorDoingAction: () => void,
] {
  const [isDoingAction, setIsDoingAction] = useState<boolean>(false);
  const [errorDoingAction, setErrorDoingAction] = useState<unknown | null>(null);

  // https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/20750
  // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
  const doActionWithState = useCallback(
    (async (...args: unknown[]): Promise<R> => {
      setIsDoingAction((prevIsDoingAction) => {
        if (prevIsDoingAction) {
          throw new ReentrancyError(doAction);
        }
        return true;
      });
      setErrorDoingAction(null);

      try {
        return await doAction(...args);
      } catch (e: unknown) {
        setErrorDoingAction(e);
        throw e;
      } finally {
        setIsDoingAction(false);
      }
    }) as F,
    [doAction],
  );

  const clearErrorDoingAction = useCallback(() => setErrorDoingAction(null), []);

  return [doActionWithState, isDoingAction, errorDoingAction, clearErrorDoingAction];
}
```

Without the cast, TS doesn't know that the shape of the args object is the same. On the return statement, TS warns:

```
Type '(...args: unknown[]) => Promise<R>' is not assignable to type 'F'.
  '(...args: unknown[]) => Promise<R>' is assignable to the constraint of type 'F', but 'F' could be instantiated with a different subtype of constraint '(...args: unknown[]) => Promise<R>'.ts(2322)
```

This remains true even if I make the args a generic type too, so I think the issue is unavoidable.",2021-02-08T20:48:15Z

Yep! But it worked in 16 haha

>With native HTML the child will never be submitted but every submit button inside that form submits the parent:

Makes sense to go with the native behaviour but in this case it's not even doing that. It's just flat out submitting **A** form (not sure which) without triggering either the child or the parent forms `onSubmit` in react.

I would expect if it were following the 'native' behaviour you describe for it to at least call the parent forms `onSubmit`",2021-02-08T21:36:33Z

> setState should works consistent and expected.

It's unclear what you mean by this specifically. ""consistent"" or ""expected"" behavior is subjective so I'd like you to ask to be more specific about the observed behavior you'd like to see.

Note that there are two potential issues with your code:

1. Your functional update in `setState` is not side-effect free.
    It must not mutate the current state.
    ```diff
    const newTodos = prevTodos.map((todo) => {
      if (todo.name === name) {
    -   todo.isDone = !todo.isDone;
    +   return  {
    +     ...todo,
    +     isDone: !todo.isDone,
    +   }
      }
      return todo;
    });
    ```
   For an exhaustive list of what needs to be side-effect free in React check out [Detecting unexpected side effects](https://reactjs.org/docs/strict-mode.html#detecting-unexpected-side-effects)
1. logging objects: these are ""live"" in the console. This means that they don't reflect their values at the time of logging but at the time of inspection. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24175017/google-chrome-console-log-inconsistency-with-objects-and-arrays for more information.

```javascript
if (listenerCount) {
// skip trying to walk up from the target looking for listeners, since none exist

```
I would see why you wouldn't want to go through function initialization a bunch of extra times in order to solve for an uncommon use case, but two lines to increment/decrement a counter on registration/deregistration, and one boolean check on event dispatching shouldn't ever have any effect on performance, whereas on a slow device, a nontrivial operation like walking through the tree on every mouseevent could probably have a noticeable effect.

All that being said if domshlak is the one raising this issue and he can't provide evidence of a noticeable performance impact, then even though his point makes sense in theory it may be a premature optimization to to solve for it.

I am not having issues with this haha. I actually just came here looking for info on how to do basic global event registration within the react event space (register events on app root which I can avoid triggering with stopPropagation, without using window and having stopProp kill all react events)",2021-02-09T18:12:39Z

776262074,"@spassvogel Thank you! That's very clever.

I'll close this issue because this fixes the React side of things. Turns out it doesn't quite work in my case anyway, but for reasons not directly related to React. (Using two background-image declarations works fine to achieve a fallback normally, but if I introduce CSS variables, Firefox stops falling back and fails to get a background image at all.) Asked about this [on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66127664/why-does-firefox-try-to-use-an-otherwise-invalid-background-image-declaration-wh).",2021-02-09T21:40:03Z

In the OP's example it could be solved by passing `setCenterPosition` like this.
In any of your cases, you would pass your dependency in the same place, this is not specific to his question.

If this warning is not handled it _can_ cause memory leaks in your application as it can cause infinite loops and re-render issues.

In the case that you want an effect to only be ran once, Chris Coyier has an excellent example [here](https://css-tricks.com/run-useeffect-only-once/)

It was a little tricky but I think I figured out a way to do it by just comparing previous and next steps: https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/20783

That said, I'm not super happy with the original thing that tries to figure out which are the primitive call frames based on the name. It doesn't work if those names are mangled anyway. Which seems pretty likely at least with ES modules when the original name doesn't need to be preserved like they are on CJS. Any ideas for that?",2021-02-10T03:31:33Z

#20777 would fix it though. Maybe we should go ahead and land that one? And figure out how it affects open source as a follow up.

776418903,"One approach could be that for each primitive we keep track of the deepest common frames we've ever seen before. So the first time we call a Hook we assume that the entire stack is a primitive. Whenever we see that Hook used in a different context we pop off as many that are not shared. Eventually we only have a list of frames that are always used with that Hook. If different primitives share the same frames, we can also pop those off.

The first time we could run the whole thing twice.

The failure case for this approach would be the first time you inspect a component and it happens to only use one primitive hook in one custom hook.

```
function useCustomHook() {
  useState(...);
}
function Component() {
  useCustomHook();
}

Improvements are significant. I use [https://github.com/intellild/react-context-performance](url) for profiling.
This implementation uses a 32bit number as a bitset. If there are more than 32 contexts, it falls back to the current logic.
Choices are:
* Keep the 32bit number, only 32 contexts are optimized
* Implement a Hash Array Mapped Trie style ""HashSet"" which can be highly optimized for this scenario.
* Use bigint
If a HashSet or bigint are used, it is possible to remove the `propagateContextChange`. Instead, we can check contexts while reconciler walking down the tree.

762523813,"@rickhanlonii Author of Hookstate is here. Hookstate uses two React hooks underneath useState and useEffect. There is no other special magic except specially maintained hash map to efficiently identify and notify (via a call to setState coming from React.useState) components affected by state change. This hash map gives React extraordinary performance boost, which you may not be seen before; see this demo of 10000 cells table state re-rending update to 1 cell every single millisecond - https://hookstate.js.org/docs/performance-frequent-updates. 

In relation to the reported bug. I disagree it was closed. And I am reopening it for the following reasons:

1. The bug happens with ONLY vanilla react hooks as Hookstate uses only vanilla react and 2 vanilla react hooks.
2. If you do not like the fact that there is a dependency to Hookstate, then copy index.ts from Hookstate to your project and use this instead of the Hookstate lib, and it will cause the crash in development tools. Would you like me to create such a reproducer repo for you?
3. Also, aren't you concerned that the crash stack trace points to the react dev tools code? I would thought that the code should be robust to the input it receives from various apps.
4. Moreover, the bug is reproducible if you simply add `React.useState(0)` - vanilla react hook - line to the sample React app: https://github.com/avkonst/hookstate/tree/master/docs/demos/todolist

Otherwise it works fine. Should you be concerned that the addition of `React.useState(0)` is a part of the cause of the bug?

It's very common for stack traces to point to React internals where the issue is sourced in user code. Since you're the expert of the way your library works, can you strip down the example to use vanilla React?",2021-01-19T01:57:15Z
762554475,"> Does using **useMemo** on _blockA_ and _blockB_ child components from the first example, prevent its rerender?

No. That memoizes the JSX and can have a similar effect to `memo`. But it doesn't provide any sort of unique ID to the tree and React will not move the tree when it changes parents.",2021-01-19T02:08:00Z
762555210,"Have you seen the code in the demo repo? I stripped down the example to just that:
```tsx
export function useState() {
    React.useState(0);
    React.useEffect(() => {
        return () => {}
    });
}
```
This is vanilla react, there is nothing left from Hookstate really. And this hook causes the crash if used twice in a component. I can not make it smaller than this. Is it good enough?",2021-01-19T02:10:50Z

import React from 'react';

function useState() {

function Counter() {
	useState();
	React.useState(0);
